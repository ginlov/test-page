I have received the Excellence Scholarship for two consecutive years. I also have industry experience as an AI engineer at TopCV Vietnam, where I contributed to the design and implementation of the recommendation system of the topcv.vn website, using deep learning techniques such as neural hash and learning to rank. Additionally, I developed and operated the duplicate checking and spelling correction systems, and created internal libraries for data preprocessing and index-preserving. I am passionate about learning new skills and technologies, and I am currently pursuing a certification in data engineering from IBM. I am fluent in English and Vietnamese, and proficient in Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and SQL.","location":{"city":"Hanoi","countryCode":"VN","region":"Hanoi"},"profiles":[{"network":"Twitter","username":"AlbertEinstein","url":"https://twitter.com/AlbertEinstein"}]},"work":[{"name":"Viettel Group","position":"Machine Learning Engineer","url":"https://viettel.com.vn/en/","startDate":"2023-06","endDate":"Now","summary":"","highlights":["Develop Viettel Machine Learning Platform (vMLP): MLOps, Model serving, Feature Store, ...","Develop Viettel Recommendation Platform (vRP): End-to-end recommendation pipeline, model serving and monitoring."]},{"name":"TopCV JSC","position":"AI Engineer","url":"https://topcv.vn/","startDate":"2021-07","endDate":"2023-04","summary":"","highlights":["TopCV Recommendation System: Propose SmartRanking algorithm boosting conversion rate by 2% in high-traffic boxes.","TopCV Spam Detection: Detect spam job.","TopCV Spelling Correction: Auto-checking and auto-correcting spelling errors in job descriptions."]}],"education":[{"institution":"Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Hanoi, Vietnam","location":"Hanoi, Vietnam","url":"https://www.hust.edu.vn/en/","area":"Computer Science","studyType":"Bachelor","startDate":"2018-08","endDate":"2023-05","score":"3.76/4.0","thesis":["Some methods for improving Diffusion Model (9.7/10)"]}],"awards":[{"title":"Exellence Scholarship for Undergraduate","date":"2021-12","awarder":"Hanoi University of Science and Technology","summary":""},{"title":"Exellence Scholarship for Undergraduate","date":"2020-12","awarder":"Hanoi University of Science and Technology","summary":""}],"certificates":[],"publications":[{"name":"On Inference Stability for Diffusion Models","publisher":"AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence","releaseDate":"2024-02","url":"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12431","summary":""}],"skills":[{"name":"AI","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Natural Language Processing","Generative Models","Diffusion Models","GAN"]},{"name":"Data Science","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Data Wrangling","Data Preparation","Machine Learning","Airflow","SQL"]},{"name":"MLOps","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["MLFlow","Seldon Core","Triton Server","Docker, Kubernetes"]}],"languages":[{"language":"Vietnamese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"IELTS Academic: 7.0","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"AI","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Generative Models","Large Language Models","AI for low-resource environments"]},{"name":"MLOps","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag","keywords":["Serverless Model serving","SaaS for AI"]}],"projects":[{"name":"Quantum Computing","summary":"Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation.
