I am a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Before moving to the US, I gained experience in various AI-related roles at [Techcom Securities](https://www.tcbs.com.vn/home), [Viettel Group](https://viettel.com.vn/en/) and [TopCV Vietnam](https://topcv.vn). I also conducted research under the supervision of Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) at [DSLab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn). My research interests include Deep Generative Models, Computer Vision and Model Optimization. I am currently seeking research opportunities at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu) and internships for the Summer 2025 in the US. I would be grateful for any introductions to relevent opportunities.
